              <p>
                We always strive for the best possible quality in everything we do. That being said, we take seriously
                any concern or complaint and will look into it promptly, for resolution as quickly as possible.
                Complaints pertaining to content that may be illegal or otherwise violates the Standards be reviewed and
                resolved within seven business days of receipt of the complaint.
              </p>
              <h3 class="fs-1">Section 21.1 Complaints Procedure</h3>
              We aim to settle the majority of complaints quickly and satisfactorily by the member of staff who provides
              the service. The complaint may be resolved quickly by way of an apology or by an acceptable explanation to
              the individual.

              <p>21.1 There are three stages to the complaint's procedure:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Stage One - The Complaint</li>
                <li>Stage Two - Investigation</li>
                <li>Stage Three - Appeal</li>
              </ul>

              <h3 class="fs-1">Stage One - The Complaint</h3>

              <p>21.2.1 The complaint must be written via email or post.</p>

              <p>
                21.2.2 Individuals wishing to make a complaint should contact the person who provided the service.
                Alternatively, they can contact us by writing to: B & C studios, Unit 13,&lt;br/&gt;Wareham Road&lt;br/&gt;Lytchett Matravers&lt;br/&gt;United Kingdom&lt;br/&gt;BH16 6FH. In the
                case of writing via post, there will be a longer processing time.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.2.3 The complaint should include the complainants name and email address used to sign up, the nature
                and date of the complaint and how they want to see it resolved.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.2.4 Complainants must receive an acknowledgement within 3 working days of receipt of a signed
                complaint. Again, when sending via post, this will take longer.
              </p>

              <h3 class="fs-1">Stage Two - Investigation</h3>
              <p>2.1 All complaints at this stage should be dealt with by a manager or director.</p>

              <p>
                21.3.2 Complaints will be fully investigated, and a written response provided to the complainant within
                ten working days by the investigator.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.3.3 The complainant will receive written confirmation of the outcome of any investigation any
                recommendations/remedies made, such as reviewing of policies, staff development and training or
                appropriate improvement to our services.
              </p>

              <p>21.3.4 Where the complaint is upheld an apology should be offered.</p>

              <p>
                21.3.5 Occasionally investigations may take longer, particularly if the complaint is complex. Should
                this be the case a holding letter will be sent after ten working days and a final date given for a
                conclusion to be reached.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.3.6 If an individual remains dissatisfied with the outcome from Stage Two they can appeal within
                fourteen working days of the date of the outcome and progress to Stage Three.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.3.7 The complaints register will be updated, and any pending complaints flagged so they are followed
                up
              </p>

              <h3 class="fs-1">Stage Three - Appeal</h3>
              <p>
                21.4.1 If the complaint cannot be resolved to the complainants satisfaction at stage two, or if the
                manager feels that the complaint is of a very serious nature, or concerns a service leader then it will
                be referred to the Director.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.4.2 The Director will acknowledge receipt within three working days, they will review the Stage Two
                investigation and recommend one of the following actions within ten working days (from the date the
                complainant stated they wanted to take the complaint to stage 3):
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>Uphold the action taken at Stage Two</li>
                <li>Make changes to the Stage Two recommendation/actions</li>
              </ul>

              <p>
                21.4.3 The complainant should be informed in writing of the outcome of stage three, the decision reached
                about this complaint will then be final but other options available to the complainant (as listed below)
                should be detailed in the letter/ email.
              </p>

              <p>
                21.4.4 If after we've been through the three stages and the complainant is still not satisfied with the
                result, they should be advised that there is no further right of appeal with us but they could approach
                any of the following agencies for advice:
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>A solicitor</li>
                <li>Citizens Advice Bureau</li>
              </ul>

              <p>This should be done within one month of receiving the outcome from the appeal.</p>
